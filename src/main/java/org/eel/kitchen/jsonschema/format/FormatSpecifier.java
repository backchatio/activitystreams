/**
 * Base class for a format specifier
 *
 * <p>The {@code format} keyword is part of draft v3, but gone in draft v4.
 * Its argument is always a string, and this string is called a "specifier".
 * The draft defines specifiers for recognizing URIs, phone numbers,
 * different date formats, and so on -- and even CSS 2.1 colors and styles!
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation covers all specifiers, the only incomplete
 * implementation being CSS styles (the {@code style} specifier).</p>
 *
 * <p>The spec allows for custom specifiers to be added. The mechanism for
 * this is not written yet, however when the day comes,
 * this is the class you will have to {@code extend}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that JSON instances of a type different than recognized by a
 * specifier validate successfully.</p>
